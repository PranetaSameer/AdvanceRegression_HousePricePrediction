## General Information
Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Business GoalÂ¶
Build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

Finding the optimal value using Ridge and Lasso Regression


## Conclusions
- The following variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes:
- Total Living Area, Basement Squarefoot, Overall Quality, Overall Condition of the house

Lasso is better model as it minimizes the features.


## Technologies Used
- pandas 
- numpy 
- sklearn 
- statsmodelapi
